<h1>appDoption</h1>

appDoption is a client-side application aimed at being a simplistic, photo-forward method for browsing pets available for adoption in your area.  This was created as my first group project at the Northwestern Web Dev bootcamp.

<h2>Data</h2>
All pet data is pulled from the Petfinder.com API and displayed to the page using jQuery.  Our goal with this was to keep things as straightforward as possible, maintaing a focus on displaying images.  Pet data is pulled via ajax, and then manipulated into cards.  We did have the ability to add minor information into the card (pet name, location, short story) while keeping it focused on the photos of the animals themselves.

<h2>Design</h2>
A requirement of this project was to use a CSS framework we were previously unfamiliar with, so we chose to make use of the Materialize framework.  Although very similar to Bootstrap (which was taught in class), Materialize was less challenging to work with and felt very straightfoward.  We appreciated its extensive color classes and clean cards.  

The appDoption logo and icons were designed using FreeLogoDesign.org.

<h2>Additional Connections</h2>
Another requirement of the project was to make use of Firebase, which we did so in adding a testimonials page.  This is somewhat of a cross between a guestbook and a comment section, allowing users of appDoption to share their pet adoption stories which are then updated in real time.

<h2>Future Iterations</h2>
Some things I would like to bring to appDoption in the future
<ul>
  <li>Better search results, and endless scroll</li>
  <li>The ability to favorite available pets, and easy clicking to share with friends and family</li>
  <li>Better use of location features</li>
